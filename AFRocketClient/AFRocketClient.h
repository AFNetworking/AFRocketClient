/**
 This class provides support for real-time networking with Rocket.
 
 Rocket is a technique for building real-time functionality on top of REST web services that leverages web standards like Server-Sent Events and JSON Patch. According to REST conventions, when a client makes an HTTP `GET` request to a resource endpoint, a list of records is returned. With Rocket, a client can additionally `SUBSCRIBE` to changes for that resource by requesting an event stream at that endpoint. Anytime a record is created, updated, or destroyed, an event is sent in real-time over the event stream, encoding the changes as a JSON Patch document.
